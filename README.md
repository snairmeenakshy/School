Bank Management System
This is a basic Python project that simulates a simple Bank Management System, built as part of a school assignment. It runs in the terminal and lets users manage bank accounts in a menu-driven way — no databases, just beginner-friendly Python.

What You Can Do: 
 Create a new bank account
 Deposit and withdraw money
 Issue a credit card with a randomly generated number
 Check account balance
 Update the account holder’s name
 Close an account
 View all existing accounts

Tech Stack: 
Language: Python 3
Library: random — used for generating credit card numbers (mock)

How to Run It: 
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer
2. Save the code in a file 
3. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or shell), navigate to the file location, and run the code
4. Use the on-screen numbered menu to interact with the system

A Few Notes: 
All data is stored in memory, so everything is reset once the program closes
Credit card numbers are randomly generated and only for simulation — they're not real
This is a great beginner project to understand how Python handles:
 * Functions
 * Dictionaries
 * Input/output
 * Control flow

Educational Purpose: 
This project was created to demonstrate core programming skills in Python as part of a school curriculum. It's simple, clean, and beginner-friendly; perfect for anyone starting out.
